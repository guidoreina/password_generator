Password generator
==================

Simple password generator in C.

The program might receive:

  - one argument: length of the password.
  - two arguments: minimum and maximum lengths of the password. The program will generate a random length in the interval [\<minlen\>, \<maxlen\>].

The program will then generate a random password, using letters, digits and special characters.
